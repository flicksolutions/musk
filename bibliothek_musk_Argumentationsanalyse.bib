  abstract = {AI could be the most trending topic of the decade. It is everywhere we turn and advancing at unprecedented speeds. This has caused the subject to be debated, discussed and analysed at great lengths.

Particularly, there are fears that AI has the potential to be a civilization-ending entity. However, as with every theory, there is always an opposing one. Many suggest that AI will, in fact, bring on the beginning of a utopian era: an era where leisure time is in abundance and suffering is at a minimum. It is even conceptualised that humans may one day augment themselves with AI, creating a powerful bond between organic and synthetic life.

But what do the EXPERTS think the future will bring?
Twenty-seventeen saw two of the biggest tech titans in the world fundamentally disagree on the future of AI. Elon Musk, the visionary CEO of Tesla, Space X, Neuralink, and Open AI, and Mark Zuckerberg, creator and CEO of the social media juggernaut Facebook.

While Musk sits on the more pessimistic side of the AI fence with a general message that we should be absolutely terrified of AI, Zuckerberg states that putting regulations in place will slow the advancement of AI, preventing us from utilising its positive benefits such as healthcare, the quest for knowledge, and online and offline security.

But is AI really a threat? \textendash{} Watch this video to find out!

Comments Made in Video Introduction:

This conversation is part of the artificial intelligence podcast. The series includes leading researchers in academia and industry, including CEO's and CTO's of automotive, robotics, AI, and technology companies.

This conversation happened after the release of the paper from our group at MIT on driver functional vigilance during use of Tesla's Autopilot. The Tesla team reached out to me offering a podcast conversation with Mr Musk. I accepted, with full control of questions I could ask and choice of what is released publicly. I ended up editing out nothing of substance.

I've never spoken with Elon before this conversation, publicly or privately. Neither he nor his companies have any influence on my opinions nor on the rigor and integrity of the scientific method that I practice in my position at MIT. Tesla has never financially supported my research. I've never owned a Tesla vehicle. I've never owned Tesla stock.

This podcast is not a scientific paper, it is a conversation. I respect Elon as I do all other leaders and engineers I've spoken with. We agree on some things and disagree on others. My goal as always with these conversations is to understand the way the guest sees the world.

One particular point of disagreement in this conversation was the extent to which camera-based driver monitoring will improve outcomes and for how long it will remain relevant for AI-assisted driving. As someone who works on and is fascinated by human-centered AI, I believe that if implemented and integrated effectively, camera-based driver monitoring is likely to be of benefit in both the short-term and the long-term. In contrast, Elon and Tesla's focus is on the improvement of Autopilot such that its statistical safety benefits override any concern of human behavior and psychology. 

Elon and I may not agree on everything, but, I deeply respect the engineering and innovation behind the efforts that he leads. My goal here is to catalyze a rigorous, nuanced, and objective discussion in industry and academia on AI-assisted driving, one that ultimately makes for a safer and better world.},

This work promises to help treat neurobiological diseases, to help us further understand the connection between the individual neuron to the high-level function of the human brain, and finally to one day expand the capacity of the brain through two-way communication with computational devices, the Internet, and artificial intelligence systems.
